# Marketing-Strategy-for-Portuguese-Bank
The project is devoted to analysing whether the client will subscribe to the term deposit in response to marketing campaigns. Quite often, banks need to avoid precarious situations in advertising their products to the targeted customers, for successful reception by the latter. The business objective is to design campaign marketing strategies for better term deposits subscription rates, given the attributes of each customer and previous campaign.
